While creating my asciinema video for my [https://wiki.aoeu.me/CS-ImageWolf-Kubernetes]() blog post, I thought to my self... why are all of these builds reproducible, but my shell just completely isn't. I want to be able to share what I do, or even run through a script, and have it type everything out! Demo's for everyone!!

So, I decided to automate my asciinema demo! And here's how!

be prepared for an anticlimax, I way over-hyped this.

Essentially, the process is pretty simple:

1. write a shell script with your demo code in it
2. run my tool on your shell script
3. ??
4. profit

Let's do it again, but together!

1: let's put together a simple shell script:

```
# hello there, this is my simple shell script!
# let's see if we can talk to google!
ping -c 3 goo.gl
# that seemed to work (I hope),
# how about setting an environment variable?
export PIZZA=good
# let's check:
echo $PIZZA
# seems legit
```

2: this is pretty obvious, but, now we run my tool on what we just wrote!

```
moredhel@dolmanax:/data/src/demoer$ ./tshell.py demo.txt 
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # hello there, this is my simple shell script!
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # let's see if we can talk to google!
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ ping -c 3 goo.gl

moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # that seemed to work (I hope),
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # how about setting an environment variable?
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ export PIZZA=good
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # let's check:
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ echo $PIZZA
good
moredhel@box:/data/src/demoer$ # seems legit
```

Now we can have reproducible, and demo-able scripts! for free!!

Maybe someone will find a use for this! but it was entertaining to build, and extremely hacky! It may come in useful though! It already has for me!
