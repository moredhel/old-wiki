# Personal Tech

I currently have a Lenovo Thinkpad x240 with 8GB ram and 2 SSD's. I'm pretty happy with it, and want to be able to reproduce the setup if I ever accidentally lose/delete everything. I also want a place where I can record my thoughts on how my laptops and general tech works in my life, and hopefully spare people the pain that I go through while also providing me with an easy to find place to refresh my memory.
