# Personal Tech

I currently have a Lenovo Thinkpad x240 with 8GB ram and 2 SSD's. I'm pretty happy with it, and want to be able to reproduce the setup if I ever accidentally lose/delete everything. I also want a place where I can record my thoughts on how my laptops and general tech works in my life, and hopefully spare people the pain that I go through while also providing me with an easy to find place to refresh my memory.

# Servers

I will do a write-up of what I'm using, and why I think they are the right options for my setup, but currently just go and look at my Wekan board for a simplified overview.
