__EDIT:__ Having worked to find a reliable and easy to configure emacs environment, I have come across an extremely successful and productive project, going by the name of [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). This project tries to achieve what other projects, such as ([Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/)) are trying to achieve.  
Being an advocate of `zsh` as a default shell, I enjoy the power and flexibility it brings to the command line. I will write more about it [here](http://aoeu.me/my-first-steps-in-configuring-spacemacs/), so watch this space for updates.

I have been looking into Yasnippet and auto-complete over the past couple of months, and have found them to be extremely useful helper tools.

In particular, the context sensitive help provided for python. I almost never find myself resorting to a quick google to find out which order to pass in variables into that library function, or what type is meant to be returned.

Combining this with flycheck, The number of errors in coding has been significantly reduced to levels I could never easily reach or maintain in vim (much as I am loath to admit it).
I have included my `.emacs` file on [github](http://github.com/hamhut1066/dotfiles) if you are interested.

The interesting lines are outlined below:

Setting flycheck so that errors can quickly be cycled through

	(global-set-key (kbd "C-c n") 'flycheck-next-error)
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'flycheck-previous-error)

Yasnippet:

	(yas-global-mode 1)
    (global-set-key "C-s" yas/expand)
    
This is an easy include, as yasnippet does the majority of its work on its own.
I have also moved the `yas/expand` function call key binding to `C-i` such that Auto-complet does not conflict with yas-expand.

Auto-complete mode:

	(require 'auto-complete-config)
	(setq-default ac-sources (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-dictionary))
	(ac-config-default)
	(ac-set-trigger-key "TAB")
	(ac-set-trigger-key "<tab>")
	(global-auto-complete-mode t)

	(setq ac-ignore-case nil)
    
Note that I have disbled case-insensitive matching, as I find this a painful experience at the best of times. 


I have mainly noted this down, because I have figured out a configuration that works for me, and I want a little context for my reasoning.

I am still to find a way to integrate yas-snippet integrations with auto-complete, do email me at hamhut (at) github-handle.com

Any pointers are welcome, I'm still newbie lisp user.
