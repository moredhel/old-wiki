# Sadness

Eight hour work day. Come home via transport, play video games, make dinner. Go to sleep.

Wake up.

Rinse and repeat.

He wasn't the smartest person in high school. He got his diploma, he got out of there, out of the system that he had always detested, watched as the honours students all went to university.

He worked every day. It was a nice job, relatively: it wasn't too horrid, not like retail had been when he was going to school, and it kept food on the table.

Eight hour work day. Bus home. Bit of Dota. Eat dinner. Sleep, wake up.

Again and again. He wasn’t even paying attention any more, he couldn’t remember what he had done yesterday, the weekends were a blur of drinking alone. Was the life of his old acquaintances like this?

No, he reminded himself. They had friends. They made friends.

He had friends, once, didn’t he? Back in school. Right. Wonder what happened to them.

Work. Bus. Game. Eat. Sleep? Get up.

He sat beside a woman on the bus. About his age, tall, beautiful.

“Hi.”

Good going. He’s not worth anything, he’s so awkward, intimidated by the idea of having human contact outside his workplace. What a failure. Waste of life.

She blushes and turns away, a little bit, then looks at him. “Hello.”

They talk, for a few minutes, before the bus stops. He gets her name - Libitina. She says it’s latin, her parents were rather into history. He doesn’t really care. She gives him her number, and gets off.

Work for a few hours. Take the bus home, but she isn’t there, that’s all right, she said she had a very time consuming job. He turns on the television. Shooting in a mall downtown.

He locks his door.

Dinner is good. It has a little more flavour, today, perhaps. But he doesn’t notice, and he goes to bed.

Wake up.

He sees her on the bus again, and he sits beside her. They talk a little - she’s into philosophy. Him? He’s into … well, not much. She recommends writing, he remembers he enjoyed it when he was in school. Makes a mental note to get some paper that his notes can be physical.

He works, and his boss tells him to go home early, you worked hard today.

She’s on the phone and they talk, him sitting in front of his computer, looking up writing guides. There was this story he always wanted to write, he remembers now, and it gnaws at him a little. He doesn’t stop smiling until he falls asleep.

They chat on the bus again and he’s a bit worried. She doesn’t look so great, today, a bit of an ashen look tinging her features. He’d ask, but knows not to pry. Perhaps she’s ill - but she was fine yesterday.

He gets a raise. His boss pats him on the back.

They talk into the night, and he’s never felt better.

He’s never had a girlfriend before, but he’s so lonely, maybe he’s found one? Maybe he’s found the one. It’s odd, but he’s never felt this eager waiting for the bus.

He doesn’t see her on the bus, today. He sits beside an elderly woman, and she smiles at him. He smiles back and they talk a little bit. She’s into philosophy.
