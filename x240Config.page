I should probably note that quite a lot of this is fairly generic, and can probably be split out into a separate Wiki page. I'm not too fussed, and will optimise/refactor as and when the need arises.

# Basics

## Keyboard

Obviously setting up Dvorak is essential, if you forget to set this up when installing the OS: `setxkbmap dvorak`.

Then remapping caps lock to control is needed!


```
# make CapsLock behave like Ctrl:
setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps

# make short-pressed Ctrl behave like Escape:
xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'
```
This isn't enough though! I actually love the functionality provided by a small utility called [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape). So one must install it! Just running it without any options is what I do, as it will remap ctrl to a desired format by default.

## Trackpad

Changing the trackpad was a bit of a pain as it is the single button trackpad. I wanted the functionality of the three button trackpad, and wanted to exclusively use the Thinkpad famous TrackPoint! I found a set of scripts that that fixed these issues, they can be found on github [faf0/thinkpad-scripts](
https://github.com/faf0/thinkpad-scripts). The README is pretty clear, and it also completely disables the trackpad which gets rid of issues when accidentally pressing your palm on it.

Another issue that I have is the 'Tap to Click' function is way too sensitive, so I just disable it. I do this by simply running the following command `synclient MaxTapTime=0`, normally just in my _startup applications_ section. It works a treat, and I never have to think about it again!

# Misc

## Firefox

I like using firefox as I can disable a considerable amount of _ring home_ functionality. I generally head over to [privacytools.io]() to configure my instance, so it's definitely worth a look.

## ZFS

ZFS on Linux is pretty stable nowadays, so is worth looking into. I like zfs, as can be seen on the [ZFS]() page.

## Window Manager

Still XMonad, I don't feel I need to qualify this, it's a marmite thing.
XMobar is my status bar, and I'm using trayer for my applets. Trayer is a bit of a pain, but it works most of the time, and can blend in nicely with XMobar...

## Private Network

I have both a VPN and a CJDNS network setup to access my server cluster. I'm not sure which is better. I feel CJDNS is not really suited to what I'm trying to use it for, and will probably just start using VPN as the main access point into my server cluster.

I think CJDNS would be nice to be running on a bunch of my laptops, and any servers I have as it cuts straight through NAT and is considerably easier to setup than VPN. I do have issues with reliability though, and hopefully that can be sorted out.

## Programs to run

### Password Manager

I'm currently using Enpass, it's not hosted and it has a decent iOS app, nuff said.

### GPG Keys

These need to be copied onto my laptop... I'm lazy and never do this...

### Backups

Why am I not doing this? I _really_ need to start regularly backing up all of my data again... I have a duplicity setup with my clusters that are backing up to AWS, but I should probably look into getting it setup with my laptop...
