This is a problem that I have been facing for a while, and was starting to annoy me somewhat.
It turns out that the fix was extremely easy. Starting with the latest version of iTerm2, tmux integration has been added to the project, which I have been using on a regular basis. I looked around for a solution, but found nothing that quite worked.
[This post](https://coderwall.com/p/-mumdg/automatically-reattach-tmux-session-using-iterm2) is what gave me the hint to successfully reattach. My main method of attempting to do this was trying to write something in my `.zshrc` file, and involved environment variables, and many if statements, and more hassle than I was actually getting out.

But, with the information on the page linked above, I could simply add the following line, and everything worked like a dream.

	tmux -CC attach -t base || tmux -CC new -t base

This I put in the iTerm2 Config, under Settings->Profiles->Send text at Startup.

I hope this helps.
