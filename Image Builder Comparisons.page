Following the release of the
Docker
[multi-stage builds](https://blog.docker.com/2017/07/multi-stage-builds/) I
suddenly became interested in alternative Image creation tools to see
if their core ideas had been undermined or whether, perhaps, they
offered an additional something which could not be offered by the
vanilla Docker build flow.

After trawling around and asking a few people for ideas of where to
look, I came across a few different build tools. I list the tools
below, If you want to skip a section, I won't be offended.

## Docker

I'll start with the most common build tool. This is supported
everywhere. We all know what it does, and we all get how it works. The
idea behind the configuration file is that it forces some semantics
when it comes to building containers. The main, and probably most
important, thing that it enforces is a 'pure' environment. An
interesting thing to note is that setting build-time variables was not
allowed in the initial versions of Docker and was only included in
version 1.7, over a year after the initial release into
open-source. This is indicative of an under powered definition file.

The idea behind the Dockerfile is that with a reduced set of commands
one can increase build times by caching previously run commands as it
assumes that each command is somewhat side-effect free. This isn't
actually the case though, and can cause issues with users who aren't
aware of the caching properties of the Docker ecosystem and end up
running old/insecure code running in production. This is a fairly
serious problem that should probably be made more clear and explicit.

Back to Build Arguments, when they were introduced there were only
allowed to be used in certain contexts. One context where these
variables were not allowed to be used is in the `FROM`
statement. There is controversy around this too, as people believe
that it should be possible to allow for variable `FROM`
statements [Github Issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/18119).

With this in mind, I started a search into the other tools to see how
they had approached some of these issues.

## Buildah

Project seg-faulted, then when I installed a VM the FS corrupted...

This project is similar to
the [acbuild](https://github.com/containers/build) tool that was
developed for creating aci or oci images. This tool deviates from
acbuild in that it doesn't create a scratch directory in the local
directory but rather creates a scratch container which it builds up
before committing it and pushing it to the desired location.

This allows for easily rolling custom bash scripts and easily
integrating that into any work-flows that already exist. What this
tool allows, that other tools do not is out-of-band work to be done
partway through a build.

## Smith

This tool is primarily aimed at wrapping up an RPM into a lightweight
container. The idea being that an RPM can be stripped down to only its
dependencies giving a lightweight container, also portability.

Using Smith to build from Docker images is also an option, but less of
a primary focus. Integration works fine, and the images created are
consistently smaller than those created even with Alpine Linux. If
saving some space on the wire is a design goal, then Smith really has
your back. Although this can also be achieved using a standard docker build.

Integration with Docker is a little challenging in that in order to
run a generated image one must first push it through a registry. The
reason being that Smith generates OCI images and Docker cannot load
them in from disk.

There is no cache for Smith, but as it is doing a slightly different
thing, the lack of a cache doesn't mean too much.

## Box

Box is perhaps the most interesting of the bunch of current Image
building tools. Instead of defining a limited (almost configuration)
language from which to build ones images, it embeds an entire, general
purpose programming language ([mRuby](http://mruby.org/)). Because of
it being Ruby, we get some really fun little things which allow us to
extend the possible operations of our build file. This is an example
of creating a Maven build operation:

```{ .ruby }
def mvn(args)
  run "mvn #{args}"
end

mvn "dependency:copy-dependencies"
```

This is a simple augmentation of the language which allows for a more
natural reading experience and more powerful build files.

Box has great integration with Docker and actually automatically loads
images into the docker local instance after a successful build. In
terms of preserving the cache Box, just like Dockerfile's, have a poor
cache. It is hard to write a package which will just work. In fact,
the Dockerfile caching mechanism is better, at the cost of insecurity
(mentioned in the first section).

## Nix

Todo...
